38,e9r0r44,9xbawu,"To seem charming, all you have to do a lot of the time is to be an engaged listener. 

You don't need an amazing sense of humor, to be able to lay on the compliments or regale people with stories. Just listen to other people in a way that shows you are interested and not only waiting for your turn to talk - make eye contact, don't interrupt them, don't turn the conversation to be about you, ask good questions.

EDIT: I just want to add, as per many comments here, that being engaged listener is not the same as being a sort of conversational doormat where you have to allow people to drone on and on about things that don't interest you, annoy you, offend you, or drain you. Merely suffering through an encounter is pretty much the opposite of what I am talking about. It's about letting yourself be interested in, and learn from, other people and not focus so much on feeling like you have to be an entertainer. 

And being an engaged listener is really the opposite of the person who just listens and never wants to talk about themselves. You are putting yourself into the conversation with your interested responses, you are guiding it to places you find interesting. Just suffering through boring conversations is not engaged listening.

The first type you should evaluate and make sure they're reasonable; not everyone becomes a billionaire (although you won't become one without trying). The second type is even more important. If you set other people's expectations to high, you might not meet them and you'll seem like you failed. It's better to set them (a little) low; that way you can outperform them and seem exceptional. Just don't set them too low or people might not respect you enough to even let you try.

146,e9saa7v,9xbawu,"The harder you squeeze the weights or bars or whatever you are gripping when you work out, with every finger, even the pinky, and all the other fibers in the hand just squeezing as hard as they can all the way around, the stronger and more durable your hands and forearms will be even if you only do low weight stuff.

The purpose of muscle building is to flex against the resistance. When you push a barbell for bench pressing, don't just push with your arms. Flex your entire body, drive your feet through the floor as you try to crush the earth with your toes and heel. Flex your chest and back, your obliques, abs, shoulders, deltoids, etc. Flex everything you can to turn your body in to a solid unit of force that is pressing against the bench, the floor, and the barbell, while the rest of your entire body is flexing for support.

Squeeze that barbell like you want to strangle the person who burned your family alive, squeeze your biceps and triceps, and push it off of you like you're pushing it in to the face of the person who did that.

If you're a noob, slow down and gradually get used to flexing harder and harder. You don't wanna pop or tear something if you aren't used to what good and dangerous levels of flexing feels like.

But, the one thing you should always try not to flex, are your neck and head muscles.

Feel your jaw, your vocal cords, everything should be relaxed as much as you can help it. That's what people mess up on, they flex with their faces and neck as they exert themselves when they shouldn't be doing that at all.

Take deep powerful continuous breaths as you flex your entire core and diaphragm. Focus on flexing your entire torso and breathing slow and deeply, focus on doing that instead of flexing your neck and face.



Same with pull ups. Start by first locking every finger around the bar and try to crush it in to powder, then flex the entire rest of your body as you do pull ups and leg raises and stuff.

When you finish, you will feel swole as hell, everything will feel pumped with blood, loosened up,  and every fiber in your body will be plenty stimulated.

You will make gains like 10x faster. So many people try to only barely use enough muscle to do the exercise. First of all, you can pull or break something without tightening up your entire torso and back and legs and shoulders and fingers when you're lifting anything heavy. Flexing = more stability, more stimulation, more power, more adrenaline, more everything, way better protection against pulling something or breaking something.

Not flexing properly while lifting = you're begging your muscles to rip and your bones to pop out like air hockey pucks.

Just watch videos of gymnasts doing their olympic ring routines and stuff, and olympic heavy lifters. Minus their facial muscles straining, you should flex like they do when doing exercises.

It also helps with running. It gives you more power and support to be conscious of your feet and ankles and keep them flexed so that they can handle the impact more and practice using those muscles to blast you off the ground with each step.

Michael Jordon was so quick not because of genetics, but because he was more actively using those muscles to bounce him off the floor with each step.

Try hanging for as long as you can, and when it gets a little fatigue-pained or you feel like its starting to slip, try to squeeze your hands and biceps and deltoids and all of that even harder and harder, mostly focusing on your hands and forearms.

You will last longer, more muscle fibers will get evenly stimulated and will support each other, and your wrists and fingers will feel way more loose and powerful, and you will tremendously increase your strength and endurance.

TL;DR flex properly when working out, flex and squeeze very hard, even on light weights, and you will get better gains and endurance and less chance of injury, and feel more loose.

**Protip for any homebound, broke people.** : Get the doorframe pullup bar for like 15 bucks and put it on your closet or bedroom doorframe. All you have to do, is focus on your hands at first. Start with just hanging, and squeezing the bar with all your fingers, and just get used to hanging on and gripping as hard and tight as you can.

Go ahead and swing a tiny bit, using your abs and back to gently pull your body up in front of you or up behind you. After a while, you can gradually try to pull yourself up.

Always put your main focus on your fingers and palm and thumb, and all the other fibers in your hands. 

Your hands and forearms are your #1 tools, and are the foundation upon which you build the rest of your body.

Nothing is more important than your ability to master the art of squeezing things with all of your fingers together, and flexing everything in your hands.

Your biceps and forearms and shoulders and triceps and stuff only contract to their fullest when the hands are fully engaged. Everything is connected, even between the lower and upper arms. 

Working out your hands sympathetically works out the rest of the arm muscles, and gives them a foundation upon which they can contract. 

Eventually work up to flexing your entire body, and make sure each section of your body you flex, the entire muscle group is flexing. Just like you want all the fingers to flex hard, you want your full bicep engaged, full tricep, etc.

It's hard to feel it all and hold the flex everywhere at once at first, but as long as you are putting in the effort to flex hard and just hold it as you hold on to the pullup bar while gripping it to death, you will gradually get better at it.

Believe me when I say the difference between controlled full-muscle flexing, and not flexing, while working out, is beyond the difference between night and day. 

Besides a cheap pullup bar for 15 bucks, the only other thing you'd want is a spot on the floor to do a pushup, and a bed or chair or anything to at least slightly elevate your feet above you. Then just practice either making a flexed fist or an open palm, and work on either holding the fist tight without letting the floor and the weight force your hand to crumble and cave in on itself, or work on getting your fingers to all press together in the open palm position as if you are trying to make your fingers do pushups as well.

You can even get on your knees and then use all 5 fingertips on each hand to hold yourself up, and do fingertip pushups. Make sure to press with every finger, especially the pinky and ring. Hold the pose or do pushups.

In just days you will feel so much more powerful, flexible, clear headed, motivated.

Trust me, exercising and putting effort in to flexing/extending all of your muscles releases so many good hormones and stuff, improves your circulatory system, burns fat all over the body more evenly, everything gets better.

It helps with adhd, depression, insomnia, etc. 

Last one. Buy any cheap pair of dumbbells, even a pair of 5 lbs would be perfect, especially 5 lbs. Because right off the bat you can move your arms in any direction and workout your shoulders.

Most important muscles in the arms are first the hands/forearms, the shoulders, and then the tris and bis.

Do arm rotations and every other shoulder exercise you can youtube with those 5lb dumbbells, while choking the fucking life out of them.

Your shoulders and deltoids and shit will feel way more powerful, and your arm sockets will get more cushion.

And then don't forget to once in a while drop all the weights, and just smoothly swing your arms, torso, legs, etc in every direction, while focusing hard on flexing them as you move them.

And do all the movements from your hips and core muscles, not your hands. Punch and swing from your body, not your arms.

Try to swing your arms left and right using only your torso, but then gradually use your arm muscles to go with those movements.

Gradually increase and decrease the range in which you swing your torso left and right. You'll go from full horizontal windmills, to rapid wushu punches.

And hold a flex while you do it. You'll feel your arms and torso get powerful and lose.

Eventually when you become decently fit, do it with those light dumbbells.

And then squats and deadlifts, just with the lightweights.

Keep the movements smooth, controlled, muscles flexed. When you speed up and you are doing negative reps, like dropping in to a crouch, drop with gravity or even drop faster, but learn how to smoothly decelerate as you go down and back up, accelerate in the middle, and decelerate.

You basically want to accelerate in the middle of your range of motion, and decelerate smoothly as you reach either end of the movement. That helps keep things from being damaged, but holy shit does it stimulate those muscles. It's basically a mix of dynamic stretching and warmups. Resistance cardio basically.

Honestly, resistance cardio, if done right, is the champion of all exercise routines.

Jog with 3 lb weights in your hands, and learn how to gently land and gently bounce off, like you're a spring.

Always try to do your reps like a spring. Quickly in the middle but smooth and slower as you hit each extreme. Like how people jump on trampolines. That's how all movements should look, springy, but controlled.

Any one of you can tremendously increase your strength and endurance and flexibility and energy and focus and happiness and self confidence, with even just a pair of 5lb dumbbells. But also get the pullup bar and do pushups, or even just hold pushups.

Trust me, any one of you can quickly quickly make gains, with light weights, if you just do a variety of movements or holds, and flex through all of the motions or holds.

It will change your life and you will love it.",t3_9xbawu,CaptainMcSpankFace

Dishonest or self-unaware people will frequently exonerate themselves completely the second someone else admits any wrong, even if they were an equal, or often bigger, contributor to the problem.

This goes doubly true in workplaces, where the perception will be that the person who admitted any wrongdoing was the guilty party. Those situations can paradoxically lead to the honest person (the person admitting their role) getting a bad reputation.

Lying in bed until you fall asleep is good if it doesn't take 3 hours, because after a while being awake in bed makes it harder to fall asleep. Basically, if you can't fall asleep, take a break and try again.

I was incredibly homeless from the time i was 17 until i was about 24. I traveled 39 continental states, lived in the wilds and in the alleys. i met crazy people, went crazy places, and did crazy shit. went to jail a couple times, got lost 100 miles from nowhere a couple times, encountered some crazy life-threatening medical situations, and generally had a really wild ride, that sometimes even im surprised i survived.  i trained with war vets, met every old fogie with crazy stories, learned from anyone with a degree who would talk to me, read a lot of books about medical herbs and cross referenced with local wild life guides, and just enjoyed meeting people.   


truckers are still some of my favorite people on the planet!  


When i was 24 i met the woman who would be my wife and the mother of my son. I got clean, ditched the drugs, started going to college, quit college, started working, and life is what it is now, im just another boring poor fucker driving a $350 broken ass truck, but im happier now. I studied computers as a child and when i was homeless i would do computer stuff for cash whenever i could find the work, so when i got married and started working, i went right back into the one real trade i know, taught myself python and am teaching myself C#, i have a decent job now, kids, a wife, my dog of 9 years(been through atleast 30 of those 39 states with me) and yea... life is what it is. when you live in a society that literally makes it impossible to stay anywhere without paying for it or being arrested, you move around alot, and when your constantly in motion, you encounter the weird shit. especially when drugs, money, or sex is involved. i cant say i approve of everything i did when i was younger, but shit happens, and obviously i learned a lot. and i dont regret a minute of it.

Next, find where it says ""DOI"" or ""DOI.org"" and copy the string that follows. It should look roughly like  

    10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60464-4  
  
Next, go to sci-hub.se and paste the DOI in the big input field in the middle of the site. You now have the full publication. If you're in a hurry to get through many studies in order to get an overall grasp on a topic, just skip to the conclusion.  
  
Also important to note is that meta-analysis is normally the golden standard for accurate and reliable insight. A good grasp on statistics is the most enlightening. If you didn't take a statistics course in college, it is never too late to enroll in a community college course or a MOOC.

A group of mates and I stole a table from our college doing that once. There was a sign-in desk at the front of the student center where you had to scan your ID to enter. I walked in with 4 guys in matching shirts behind me, and I was carrying a clipboard. We walked straight past the person at the desk, I pointed out a table and jotted some scribbled down, they packed up one of the tables, and walked out, never got questioned.

Quickly explained that we were very much the opposite of upset and wanted her manager to know how amazing she was.  And that's when the tears really started flowing.
