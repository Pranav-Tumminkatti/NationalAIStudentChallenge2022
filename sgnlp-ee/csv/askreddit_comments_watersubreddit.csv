1,dwg33yp,87wckw,"A lot of pushups, running in place, masturbation, meditation and trying to recall specific memories in detail.  I'd try to think about specific things I've learned in a lot of detail.  I'd do a lot of praying. 

I think I'd try to teach lessons out loud or practice speeches, make up songs / poems / dirty limericks / jokes etc.  I'd try to take a topic such as outer space and recall everything that I know on this topic.  I'd also day dream a lot, and probably rant about things that had troubled me in the past.  I would not be ashamed or afraid to speak out loud.",t3_87wckw,Historic_LFK

I think I would end up playing with my food a lot to pass the time. Like that game where you get a bottle of water to stand on end, or making sculptures out of mash potatoes, that sort of thing. If I get bored with that I'd resort of mental mathematics. I'd also try to keep physical active, push-ups, sit-ups, etc. ",t3_87wckw,ZhouDa
6,dwg1quf,87wckw,"One month in an empty room in exchange for enough money to comfortably retire on and never work again in my life? I'd take the deal.

It would be challenging but definitely worth it.",t3_87wckw,manwithoutlegs
7,dwg2u4m,87wckw,"I would try to vividly remember everything I've ever liked.  I'd think of songs, books and movies I like and try to dissect what I like about them and how they relate to other things and what they mean to me. Greatest hits of memories. Think of the future. Think about what kind of life I want to live when I get out, try to prioritize what means the most to me and plan what steps I can take when I get out to make what I've been thinking about a reality. 

I think it's doable if you know it's only a month and there is a reward at the end.  When people go crazy from isolation it tends to be because they have no idea if or when it will end. Even if it does end, the future still tends to be bleak. The hopeless is what gets you, not the isolation. ",t3_87wckw,Relax007

I spend most of my time alone so the lack of people wouldn't bother me I don't think. However, I don't spend all my time alone just eating, drinking, sleeping and staring at four walls which I would be doing in the experiment. That would be tough.

Edit: I also think a difficult aspect of the experiment would be not knowing what's happening in the world around you. With information always seconds away with our devices, a month without that information at our fingertips would be irritating, in my opinion.",t3_87wckw,
9,dwg1g6c,87wckw,"I'd probably have a full on mental breakdown at some point. It would be hell and I'd hate it. But, the month would end, I'd have 5 million dollars and a pretty good premise for a book.",t3_87wckw,S_B_C_R

28,dwgbkgx,87wckw,"I accept the challenge because initially all I see is green and the number of trailing zeros at the end of that payout. 

Day 1: 

I enter the room and I entertain myself pretty well for the about the first 10 minutes. Then I itch for my phone and for the ability to scroll Reddit or check my messages. I violently crush those thoughts and try to focus on something else, like what I would do with the money and how much I would allocate to a specific thing. 

I’m also thinking about all the cool things I’ll be able to do and all the countries I’ll be able to visit. Somewhere in the back of my mind the itch to Google something or look something up is always present, but it eventually becomes more wishful thinking than an itch.  

I am able to occupy some of my time this way.

Day 2-4:

Much of it goes like Day 1, except the loneliness is gradually getting larger.

Day 5-6: 

My thoughts have moved past what I will be doing with the money and now existential questions are hitting me, like what will I do with my life from now on? How will this impact my relationships? Is there a God? How do I masturbate without porn?


Day 7-10:

I decide that I must find some hobbies, even if isolated. At this point it’s only been a week but I miss my boyfriend, I miss my friends, and I miss knowing what’s going on in the world. I even miss the Kardashians dammit. I practice singing because at least my voice will only torture myself this way. I try to make up some poetry or fantasize about what kind of DnD storyline I would make up if I was a dungeon master. Little things that keep me creative despite not having things like paper and a pencil.

Day 11:

Sadness and the fact that I’ve had no human contact for 11 days hit. I spend most of this day crying, just hit by a giant wave of loneliness and paranoia about what might be happening in the outside world. What if someone I love was hurt, or worse, DEAD? I would have no way of knowing. That is the most terrifying part.

Day 12-13:

Much like Day 11, but increasingly manic. When I’m not crying I fill the empty hours with sleep.

Day 14: 

It’s getting near the halfway point. I have to struggle it out - I’ve dedicated so much time already. I decide that maybe I’ll write a book about it, and brainstorm thoughts.

Day 15:

I start to sleep more, exercise a bit; being alone with my thoughts make them too loud, so I try to keep myself occupied. 

I start talking to myself a little more.

Day 16 - 30 I can’t fathom really.

There's a high likelihood that I'd start pulling apart various things in the room to make them more engaging. Knotwork from fabric, pull the toilet apart just to see if I could put it back together again... I'd try making jailhouse booze, cheese, and dyes.

Assuming there's toilet paper, it wouldn't be difficult to have some serious arts and crafts time, but if a bidet is involved, it would probably take 30 days alone just to get used to the sensation of intentionally subjecting myself to Neptune's Kiss.

You start to feel miserable, feel unworthy of human attention or just feel to apathetic to bother. Then you end up isolating yourself, shutting yourself off from human contact and the outside world. A lot of the time other people don't know that you're suffering as you didn't tell them because you genuinely believe they won't care or that it'll bother them. So often they won't come to visit you or check in on you, which only feeds that rapidly growing feeling of being neglected, worthless and uncared for. The repetitive nature of your activities fails to stimulate you properly, but the depression causes you to withdraw more and more, rather than to seek out new activities or stimulus like someone with a healthy mind would do. It's fuckin horrible and it's so easy for that cycle to suck you in and smother you before you even know what's happening. It's why whenever I feel my depression starting to creep into the corners of my mind, I force myself to exercise, to get out of the house once a day and at least tell my friends what's going on so they can make up their mind as to whether they want to come and see me or not and will at least check on me.

Just based on opinion I definitely don't believe color to be the most important thing for mental stimulus. That said, there are studies about It being important so take my words with a grain of salt.

Personally, I definitely think that the inability to measure time is far more devastating for the human mind. We must keep track of everything based on time. Long term memory formation, sleep cycles, emotional health are all controlled by our cycle of night and day. When that gets interrupted and we don't have an anchor to say ""yes, I stubbed my toe on a Monday!"" and that memory becomes an event in an endless stream of events with no anchor to separate them then you start going nuts.

Imagine not being able to accurately remember the sequence of events... I took a shower, took my shoes off, put them on, put then under the bed. Obviously it may not be so extreme but you can imagine how lost you'd be once your ability to grasp and mark your position in time is gone. ",t3_87wckw,

You’ve pretty much nailed the cycle. I break it and I feel a thousand times better but the cycle of self-misery is a lot fucking easier and far more seductive than all the work to get out. This is of course with help of a therapist who even got to the point of thinking I was a-OK

When the break up happened she warned me not to hole myself away (going into therapy herself, done a lot of work with anxiety and trauma for herself) as she knew exactly what it would entail. And in typical gender stereotyped male fashion I'm not always very emotionally vulnerable (with her being a big exception) and am a pretty quiet and thoughtful person. I’ve done my best by living with others so I can only withdraw so much. Luckily I’ve always been good at school and the expectation of being somewhere and showing up for shit (unfortunately sporadic work) is something I value so I haven’t hit the depths that are possible but I am quite scared if I move out and go for it alone then I’ll hit those depths real quickly.

Just wanted to say thanks for summarizing something that probably plagues more than 30% of us but society doesn’t want to really accept it since it means you’re not a functioning capitalist. 

Even if it’s hard for me to convince myself, there’s beauty in life thats worth living even if it requires enduring pain in between. PM me if you ever need it (and if you’re male even better because the western culture around depression in men is entirely fucked) ",t3_87wckw,calfmonster

They were in an all out war and every day after school I'd go back and check the progress on the carnage. The black colony would make progress most days, pushing the reds back stone by stone. Eventually, the reds had their larva rooms invaded and begin evacuating; I could see ants carrying individual larvae away from the black invaders in a desperate struggle to preserve their colony. After a while, all reds had either fled to a new site or were exterminated, and only the blacks were left. It was a wild ride.

Edit! 

Inspired by our witnessing of The Great Ant War, my brother and I decided to get a couple of ant colonies. We went all out and got like 3 or 4 different ones with little tube connectors that would let your colony expand indefinitely. After blowing through money on all that, we looked into getting some high-quality ants shipped in from out of state, but decided we should save on our ants and get some from the back yard. 

We intercepted several convoys traveling an ant highway (as they release scents when returning from food sources for others to follow in line) and began building our colony. It was a peaceful colony of tunneling and ants just doing what ants do...at first. On one of our resupplies we must've inadvertently picked up an ant in the same spot from another colony and we unknowingly dropped him to his doom. 

The next day after dropping the fresh ant in, I noticed something odd in the corner at the surface. There was a little pile of rubble formed from a hole that was dug out. In it...was the dismembered remains of the new ant. The others must've figured out he wasn't from around there and they cut his head and legs off and neatly piled him up in the corner.

509,dwgpme0,dwgfu23,"*The Night Vale Psychological Association, in conjunction with a Vague, Yet Menacing Government Agency, has asked that all citizens start keeping dream journals. Dream journals can be a spiritually satisfying exercise in understanding your unconscious mind, helping you to fully examine your being, and balance your emotions. They also can be rife with useful data for government officials and corporate marketing executives.*

*Of course, dear listeners, many of you are saying, “Well, this sounds fantastic, Cecil, but how do you keep a dream journal?” Good question.*

*I have kept one for years now, and I must say I agree with the NVPA on this. It seems hard, at first, because you have to get in the habit of writing first thing in the morning, and also because the City Council’s ban on all writing utensils is still in full effect. But once you learn how to create a makeshift non-pen out of a cocktail straw, some cotton, and any number of colorful municipal food pastes, you’ll be good to go.*

*In an effort to educate Night Vale citizens about dream Journaling, the NVPA has created this helpful how-to:*

- *Step One: Find a foreign dictionary or hymnal. It is strongly preferred that you choose something in Russian or Ukrainian, but German will work too.*
- *Step Two: Carve out several pages, creating a secret compartment in the book.*
- *Step Three: Write down your dream in great detail the moment you wake up.*
- *Step Four (and this is the most important step of all): Eat the paper you wrote the dream on, and then place a bird skeleton in the book.*
- *Finally, bury the book near a magnolia or willow tree, and repeat each day.*

*The sooner you start this process, listeners, the sooner you can start actualizing your existence, exploring your inner self, and the sooner the Sheriff’s Secret Police can track down and arrest those vile miscreants who keep dreaming about horses.*",t3_87wckw,havron

But boot camp moved in phases when I went (don't know if that's still the case or if it varies per post). Red, white, and blue, each being 3 weeks and we marched under a flag indicating which phase we were in. Graduation phase (last week) marched under the US flag. Going by phases would've been faster than a period (or at least would've been faster than my natural period, had I had one at the time. Folks vary).


Also, some ladies get it *bad* and they're in even more pain/discomfort doing physical activity and not having access to dietary help (teas and such can help with cramping). Glad I didn't have one!",t3_87wckw,SomeBroadYouDontKnow
